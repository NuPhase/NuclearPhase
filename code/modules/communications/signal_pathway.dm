Variables:
	sender_penetration - determines how far a signal can travel without starting being blocked by something.
	penetration_modifier - a general modifier for how well the signal penetrates objects
	receiver_amplification - how much quality boost does a signal receive

	zdistance - how much distance do we have between Z of the sender and Z of the receiver
	zblockage - how much quality we take away per unit of zdistance
